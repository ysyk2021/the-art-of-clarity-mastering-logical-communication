Understanding SMART Goals

SMART goals are a framework for setting goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. By setting SMART goals, you can ensure that your goals are well-defined, realistic, and achievable.

The following are the five components of SMART goals:

* **Specific:** Goals should be clear and well-defined, with a specific outcome in mind.
* **Measurable:** Goals should be quantifiable, meaning that progress can be tracked and measured over time.
* **Achievable:** Goals should be realistic and attainable given your skills, resources, and constraints.
* **Relevant:** Goals should be aligned with your overall objectives, values, and priorities.
* **Time-bound:** Goals should have a specific deadline or time frame for completion.

Setting SMART Goals

To set SMART goals for logical communication, follow these steps:

1. **Define your objective:** Start by defining what you want to achieve through logical communication. What is your desired outcome?
